We apply Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the computation of reduced basis space. On the other hand, for the evaluation of the modal coefficients, we use two different methodologies: the one based on the Galerkin projection (G) and the other one based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We aim at comparing POD-G and POD-ANN in terms of relevant features including errors and computational efficiency. In this context, both physical and geometrical parametrization are considered. We also carry out a validation of the Full Order Model (FOM) based on customized benchmarks in order to provide a complete computational pipeline. The framework proposed is applied to a relevant industrial problem related to the investigation of thermomechanical phenomena arising in blast furnace hearth walls.}

This work extends the results presented for parametrized steady Stokes and Navier-Stokes problems in a work of ours \cite{Ali2018}. We apply classical residual-based stabilization techniques for finite element methods in full order, and then the RB method is introduced as Galerkin projection onto RB space. We compare this approach with supremizer enrichment options through several numerical experiments. We are interested to (numerically) guarantee the parametrized reduced inf-sup condition and to reduce the online computational costs.}

  abstract = {In this work, we propose to efficently solve time dependent parametrized optimal control problems governed by parabolic partial differential equations through the certified reduced basis method. In particular, we will exploit an error estimator procedure, based on easy-to-compute quantities which guarantee a rigorous and efficient bound for the error of the involved variables. First of all, we propose the analysis of the problem at hand, proving its well-posedness thanks to Nečas - Babuška theory for distributed and boundary controls in a space-time formulation. Then, we derive error estimators to apply a Greedy method during the offline stage, in order to perform, during the online stage, a Galerkin projection onto a low-dimensional space spanned by properly chosen high-fidelity solutions. We tested the error estimators on two model problems governed by a Graetz flow: a physical parametrized distributed optimal control problem and a boundary optimal control problem with physical and geometrical parameters. The results have been compared to a previously proposed bound, based on the exact computation of the Babu\v ska inf-sup constant, in terms of reliability and computational costs. We remark that our findings still hold in the steady setting and we propose a brief insight also for this simpler formulation.}

In particular, we provide several insights on how the introduction of an elastic structure influences the bifurcating behaviour. We have addressed the computational burden by developing a reduced order branch-wise algorithm based on a monolithic Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. We compared different constitutive relations for the solid, and we observed that a nonlinear hyper-elastic law delays the bifurcation w.r.t. the standard model, while the same effect is even magnified when considering linear elastic solid.}

Such approximations are based on a Reduced Order Model, which in this work is constructed using the method of weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. This Reduced Order Model then is used to efficiently compute the reduced basis approximation for any outcome of the random parameter. We demonstrate that such OCPs are well-posed by applying the adjoint approach, which also works in the presence of admissibility constraints and in the case of non linear-quadratic OCPs, and thus is more general than the conventional Lagrangian approach. We also show that a step in the construction of these Reduced Order Models, known as the aggregation step, is not fundamental and can in principle be skipped for noncoercive problems, leading to a cheaper online phase. Numerical applications in three scenarios from environmental science are considered, in which the governing PDE is steady and the control is distributed. Various parameter distributions are taken, and several implementations of the weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition are compared by choosing different quadrature rules.}

  preprint = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11460},
  abstract = {Natural convection in porous media is a highly nonlinear multiphysical problem relevant to many engineering applications (e.g., the process of CO2 sequestration). Here, we present a non-intrusive reduced order model of natural convection in porous media employing deep convolutional autoencoders for the compression and reconstruction and either radial basis function (RBF) interpolation or artificial neural networks (ANNs) for mapping parameters of partial differential equations (PDEs) on the corresponding nonlinear manifolds. To benchmark our approach, we also describe linear compression and reconstruction processes relying on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and ANNs. We present comprehensive comparisons among different models through three benchmark problems. The reduced order models, linear and nonlinear approaches, are much faster than the finite element model, obtaining a maximum speed-up of 7 * 10^6 because our framework is not bound by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition; hence, it could deliver quantities of interest at any given time contrary to the finite element model. Our model's accuracy still lies within a mean squared error of 0.07 (two-order of magnitude lower than the maximum value of the finite element results) in the worst-case scenario. We illustrate that, in specific settings, the nonlinear approach outperforms its linear counterpart and vice versa. We hypothesize that a visual comparison between principal component analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) could indicate which method will perform better prior to employing any specific compression strategy.}

  abstract = {Numerical stabilization is often used to eliminate (alleviate) the spurious oscillations generally produced by full order models (FOMs) in under-resolved or marginally-resolved simulations of convection-dominated flows. In this paper, we investigate the role of numerical stabilization in reduced order models (ROMs) of marginally-resolved convection-dominated flows. Specifically, we investigate the FOM-ROM consistency, i.e., whether the numerical stabilization is beneficial both at the FOM and the ROM level. As a numerical stabilization strategy, we focus on the evolve-filter-relax (EFR) regularization algorithm, which centers around spatial filtering. To investigate the FOM-ROM consistency, we consider two ROM strategies: (I) the EFR-ROM, in which the EFR stabilization is used at the FOM level, but not at the ROM level; and (ii) the EFR-EFRROM, in which the EFR stabilization is used both at the FOM and at the ROM level. We compare the EFR-ROM with the EFR-EFRROM in the numerical simulation of a 2D flow past a circular cylinder in the convection-dominated, marginally-resolved regime. We also perform model reduction with respect to both time and Reynolds number. Our numerical investigation shows that the EFR-EFRROM is more accurate than the EFR-ROM, which suggests that FOM-ROM consistency is beneficial in convection-dominated,marginally-resolved flows.}

In particular, the proposed mesh-morphing approach may lead to a parameterized weak form whose bilinear and linear forms are affine in the geometric parameter of interest, i.e. the fiber radius. As a result, we may certify the reduced basis analysis of a square unit cell model for any parameters in a predetermined parameter domain with a rigorous a posteriori error bound. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed geometric parameterization, we consider a two-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction analysis dependent on two parameters: a fiber radius and a thermal conductivity. For rapid yet rigorous a posteriori error evaluation, we estimate a lower bound of a coercivity constant via the min-theta method as well as the successive constraint method. Compared to the corresponding finite element analysis, the constructed reduced basis analysis may yield nearly the same solution at a computational speed about 29 times faster on average. In conclusion, the proposed geometric parameterization scheme is conducive for accurate yet efficient reduced basis analysis.}

As the conductivity of porous media can be highly heterogeneous and span several orders of magnitude, we utilize the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method as a full order solver to handle discontinuity and ensure local mass conservation during the offline stage. We then use POD as a data compression tool and compare the nested POD technique, in which time and uncertain parameter domains are compressed consecutively, to the classical POD method in which all domains are compressed simultaneously. The neural networks are finally trained to map the set of uncertain parameters, which could correspond to material properties, boundary conditions, or geometric characteristics, to the collection of coefficients calculated from an L2 projection over the reduced basis. We then perform a non-intrusive evaluation of the neural networks to obtain coefficients corresponding to new values of the uncertain parameters during the online stage. We show that our framework provides reasonable approximations of the DG solution, but it is significantly faster. Moreover, the reduced order framework can capture sharp discontinuities of both displacement and pressure fields resulting from the heterogeneity in the media conductivity, which is generally challenging for intrusive reduced order methods. The sources of error are presented, showing that the nested POD technique is computationally advantageous and still provides comparable accuracy to the classical POD method. We also explore the effect of different choices of the hyperparameters of the neural network on the framework performance.}

The generality of the proposed algorithm is validated with a numerical test based on environmental sciences: a reduced optimal control problem governed by Shallow Waters Equations parametrized not only in the physics features, but also in the geometrical ones.

In this context, inf-sup stability is usually recovered through the enrichment of the velocity space with suitable supremizer functions. The main goal of this work is to propose an alternative approach, which relies on the residual based stabilization techniques customarily employed in the Finite Element literature, such as Brezzi-Pitkaranta, Franca-Hughes, streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin, Galerkin Least Square. In the spirit of offline-online reduced basis computational splitting, two such options are proposed, namely offline-only stabilization and offline-online stabilization.

  abstract = {We propose a simulation-based decision strategy for the proactive maintenance of complex structures with a particular application to structural health monitoring (SHM). The strategy is based on a data-driven approach which exploits an offline–online decomposition. A synthetic dataset is constructed offline by solving a parametric time-dependent partial differential equation for multiple input parameters, sampled from their probability distributions of natural variation. The collected time-signals, extracted at sensor locations, are used to train classifiers at such sensor locations, thus constructing multiple databases of healthy configurations. These datasets are then used to train one class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVMs) to detect anomalies. During the online stage, a new measurement, possibly obtained from a damaged configuration, is evaluated using the classifiers. Information on damage is provided in a hierarchical manner: first, using a binary feedback, the entire structure response is either classified as inlier (healthy) or outlier (damaged). Then, for the outliers, we exploit the outputs of multiple classifiers to retrieve information both on the severity and the spatial location of the damages. Because of the large number of signals needed to construct the datasets offline, a model order reduction strategy is implemented to reduce the computational burden. We apply this strategy to both 2D and 3D problems to mimic the vibrational behavior of complex structures under the effect of an active source and show the effectiveness of the approach for detecting and localizing cracks.}

  abstract = {This work deals with optimal control problems as a strategy to drive bifurcating solutions of nonlinear parametrized partial differential equations towards a desired branch. Indeed, for these governing equations, multiple solution configurations can arise from the same parametric instance. We thus aim at describing how optimal control allows to change the solution profile and the stability of state solution branches. First of all, a general framework for nonlinear optimal control problems is presented in order to reconstruct each branch of optimal solutions, discussing in detail the stability properties of the obtained controlled solutions. Then, we apply the proposed framework to several optimal control problems governed by bifurcating Navier-Stokes equations in a sudden-expansion channel, describing the qualitative and quantitative effect of the control over a pitchfork bifurcation and commenting in detail the stability eigenvalue analysis of the controlled state. Finally, we propose reduced order modeling as a tool to efficiently and reliably solve parametric stability analysis of such optimal control systems, which can be unbearable to perform with standard discretization techniques such as the Finite Element Method.}

Our focus is on steady bifurcations. Plotting a bifurcation diagram entails computing multiple solutions of a parametrized, nonlinear problem, which can be extremely expensive in terms of computational time. In order to reduce these demanding computational costs, our approach combines a continuation technique and Newton's method with a reduced order modeling (ROM) technique, suitably supplemented with a hyperreduction method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our ROM approach, we trace the steady solution branches of a nonlinear Schrodinger equation, called the Gross--Pitaevskii equation, as one or two physical parameters are varied. In the two-parameter study, we show that our approach is 60 times faster in constructing a bifurcation diagram than a standard full order method.}

The approach is studied for an extended version of the classical driven-cavity setup involving a non-affine parameterization of the prescribed mesh deformation and a time-dependent non-homogeneous lid-flow boundary condition.},

Such preprocessing is based on the composition of the snapshots with a transport map, that is a family of smooth and invertible mappings that map the physical domain of the problem into itself. Two test cases are considered: a fluid moving in a domain with deforming walls, and a fluid past a rotating cylinder. Comparison between the results of the novel offline stage and the standard one is presented.}

The Reduced Order Models (ROMs) presented in this manuscript are based on a POD-Galerkin approach with a VMS stabilization technique. Two different reduced order models are presented, which differ on the stabilization used during the Galerkin projection. In the first case the VMS stabilization method is used at both the full order and the reduced order level. In the second case, the VMS stabilization is used only at the full order level, while the projection of the standard Navier-Stokes equations is performed instead at the reduced order level. The former method is denoted as consistent ROM, while the latter is named non-consistent ROM, in order to underline the different choices made at the two levels. Particular attention is also devoted to the role of inf-sup stabilization by means of supremizers in ROMs based on a VMS formulation. Finally, the developed methods are tested on a numerical benchmark.}

In particular, we consider stochastic elliptic PDEs with an affine dependence on the random variable. The goal is to recover the entire solution map from the parameter space to the finite element space. To this end, first, a reduced-basis solution using a weak greedy algorithm is constructed, then a DLS approximation is determined by evaluating the reduced-basis approximation instead of the full finite element approximation. The main advantage of the new approach is that one only need apply the DLS operator to the coefficients of the reduced-basis expansion, resulting in huge savings in both the storage of the DLS coefficients and the online cost of evaluating the DLS approximation. In addition, the recently developed quasi-optimal polynomial space is also adopted in the new approach, resulting in superior convergence rates for a wider class of problems than previous analyzed. Numerical experiments are provided that illustrate the theoretical results.}
