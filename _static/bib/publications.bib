The methodology proposed is based on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition within a levelset geometry description and the problems of interest are discretized with an unfitted mesh Finite Element Method. We construct and investigate a unified and geometry independent reduced basis which overcomes many barriers and complications of the past, that may occur whenever geometrical morphings are taking place. By employing a geometry independent reduced basis, we are able to avoid remeshing and transformation to reference configurations, and we are able to handle complex geometries. This combination of a fixed background mesh in a fixed extended background geometry with reduced order techniques appears beneficial and advantageous in many industrial and engineering applications, which could not be resolved efficiently in the past.}

As a final goal, we manage to find an efficient global, concerning the geometrical manifold, and independent of geometrical changes, reduced-order basis. The POD-Galerkin approach exhibits its strength even with pseudo-random discontinuous initial data verified by numerical experiments. }

Our aim is to show how reduced order modelling could help in studying different configurations and phenomena in a fast way. After building the optimality system, we rely on a POD-Galerkin reduction in order to solve the optimal control problem in a low dimensional reduced space. The presented theoretical framework is actually suited to general nonlinear time dependent optimal control problems. The proposed methodology is finally tested with a numerical experiment: the reduced optimal control problem governed by shallow waters equations reproduces the desired velocity and height profiles faster than the standard model, still remaining accurate.}

For problems in computational fluid dynamics, the lack of inf-sup stability is reflected by the inability to accurately approximate the pressure field. In this context, inf-sup stability is usually recovered through the enrichment of the velocity space with suitable supremizer functions. The main goal of this work is to propose an alternative approach, which relies on the residual based stabilization techniques customarily employed in the Finite Element literature, such as Brezzi-Pitkaranta, Franca-Hughes, streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin, Galerkin Least Square. In the spirit of offline-online reduced basis computational splitting, two such options are proposed, namely offline-only stabilization and offline-online stabilization. These approaches are then compared to (and combined with) the state of the art supremizer enrichment approach. Numerical results are discussed, highlighting that the proposed methodology allows to obtain smaller reduced basis spaces (i.e., neglecting supremizer enrichment) for which a modified inf-sup stability is still preserved at the reduced order level.}

Reduced order methods are a suitable approach to have rapid and accurate simulations. We rely on POD-Galerkin reduction over the physical and geometrical parameters of the optimality system in a space-time formulation.

The aim of these applications is to match known physiological data with numerical hemodynamics corresponding to different scenarios, arisen by tuning some parameters. Such applications are an initial step towards matching patient-specific physiological data in patient-specific vascular geometries as best as possible.
Two critical challenges that reportedly arise in such problems are, (i). lack of robust quantification of meaningful boundary conditions required to match known data as best as possible and (ii). high computational cost. In this work, we utilize unknown control variables in the optimal flow control problems to take care of the first challenge. Moreover, to address the second challenge, we propose a time-efficient and reliable computational environment for such parameterized problems by projecting them onto a low-dimensional solution manifold through proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)--Galerkin.}

The strategy is based on a data-driven approach which exploits an offline‚Äìonline decomposition. A synthetic dataset is constructed offline by solving a parametric time-dependent partial differential equation for multiple input parameters, sampled from their probability distributions of natural variation. The collected time-signals, extracted at sensor locations, are used to train classifiers at such sensor locations, thus constructing multiple databases of healthy configurations. These datasets are then used to train one class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVMs) to detect anomalies. During the online stage, a new measurement, possibly obtained from a damaged configuration, is evaluated using the classifiers. Information on damage is provided in a hierarchical manner: first, using a binary feedback, the entire structure response is either classified as inlier (healthy) or outlier (damaged). Then, for the outliers, we exploit the outputs of multiple classifiers to retrieve information both on the severity and the spatial location of the damages. Because of the large number of signals needed to construct the datasets offline, a model order reduction strategy is implemented to reduce the computational burden. We apply this strategy to both 2D and 3D problems to mimic the vibrational behavior of complex structures under the effect of an active source and show the effectiveness of the approach for detecting and localizing cracks.}

In order to reduce these demanding computational costs, our approach combines a continuation technique and Newton's method with a Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) technique, suitably supplemented with a hyper-reduction method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our ROM approach, we trace the steady solution branches of a nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation, called Gross-Pitaevskii equation, as one or two physical parameters are varied. In the two parameter study, we show that our approach is 60 times faster in constructing a bifurcation diagram than a standard Full Order Method.},

The main advantage of the new approach is that one only need apply the DLS operator to the coefficients of the reduced-basis expansion, resulting in huge savings in both the storage of the DLS coefficients and the online cost of evaluating the DLS approximation.

Then, we rely on model order reduction methods over the lower dimensional parameter subspace, based on a POD-Galerkin approach, to further reduce the required computational effort and enhance computational efficiency.}

  abstract = {In this work we consider (hierarchical, Lagrange) reduced basis approximation and a posteriori error estimation for elasticity problems in affinley parametrized geometries. The essential ingredients of the methodology are: a Galerkin projection onto a low-dimensional space associated with a smooth "parametric manifold" - dimension reduction, an efficient and effective greedy sampling methods for identification of optimal and numerically stable approximations - rapid convergence, an a posteriori error estimation procedures - rigorous and sharp bounds for the functional outputs related with the underlying solution or related quantities of interest, like stress intensity factor, and Offline-Online computational decomposition strategies - minimum marginal cost for high performance in the real-time and many-query (e.g., design and optimization) contexts. We present several illustrative results for linear elasticity problem in parametrized geometries representing 2D Cartesian or 3D axisymmetric configurations like an arc-cantilever beam, a center crack problem, a composite unit cell or a woven composite beam, a multi-material plate, and a closed vessel. We consider different parametrization for the systems: either physical quantities - to model the materials and loads - and geometrical parameters - to model different geometrical configurations - with isotropic and orthotropic materials working in plane stress and plane strain approximation. We would like to underline the versatility of the methodology in very different problems. As last example we provide a nonlinear setting with increased complexity.}

Both the high-fidelity and reduced-order methods are based on a Chorin-Temam operator-splitting approach. Two different reduced-order methods are proposed, which differ on velocity continuity condition, imposed weakly or strongly, respectively. The resulting ROMs are tested and compared on a representative haemodynamics test case characterized by wave propagation, in order to assess the capabilities of the proposed strategies.},
